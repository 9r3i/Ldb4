This is the 4th one, I don't know, but I think this is the last one of Ldb class.

I have the API for this class, as well, and the API is similiar to the others but this is the fastest one of Ldb's classes for reading data. For more detail, just take alook to the file: Ldb4-api.txt

Feel free to use this class, but if you wanna use this class, please remind the license. Thank you.
